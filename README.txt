This repository contains a simple website similar to YouTube. It includes:
- The ability to log into the account (I did not add the registration system, so the data for the test account is [Mail: thekokspl@adres.com, Password: qwerty123]),
- Watching other users' videos on the website,
- You can also enter another user's profile and view all their films,
- It is possible to follow the user,
- The entire website is also adapted to mobile devices.

Unfortunately due to github restrictions I can't put videos here.
